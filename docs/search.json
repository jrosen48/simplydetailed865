Little did I know, when I cleaned for my very first clients, through word-of-mouth only, I could create a full time career out of it. I truly fell in love with the job, my clients have become dear friends and family. As I became too busy to handle it alone, the idea to create a business was a natural progression. Through professionalism, hard work, a lot of love and offering clients detailed cleans to their specifications, Simply Detailed was born. I look forward to meeting new clients in the future!"
